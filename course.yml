title: Quick & Dirty Data Visualization in R
description: Here we will teach you how to use qplot to quickly visualize your data.  Many R users use an elegant,
  flexible and powerful package called 'ggplot' but mastering this can be overwhelming
  at first.  Instead we're going to focus on a short-cut function of ggplot called qplot() which
  can be used to create the most common types of graphs and simple analysis.  Along the way you will probably be suprised how powerful and simple qplot is and at the end you may be even inspired to level up with the broader and deeper universe of  ggplot.
