title: Quick & Dirty Data Visualization
description: warning - this might be the most fun part of the course and here we'll
  teach you how to use qplot to quickly visualize your data.  Many R users use an  elegant,
  flexible and powerful package called 'ggplot' but mastering this can be overwhelming
  at first.  Instead we're going to focus on a short-cut function called qplot()  which
  can be used to create the most common types of graphs and might fit your needs when
  making simple graphics. You'll probably be suprised how powerful it is and may be
  even inspired to go up a weight class later with ggplot.
